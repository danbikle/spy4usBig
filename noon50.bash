# This script should call ml101.bash with correct variables.

# This should give me a YRS amount of predictions:
export YRS=15
# YRS should be >= TRAIN_YRS
# Each prediction should train from TRAIN_YRS amount of observations:
export TRAIN_YRS=10

# This should be yes when I want a prediction near calif-noon:55 m-f:
export HTML=yes
# At night, if I set HTML=yes a duplicate observation of the most recent close
# will appear in the data.
# So, at night, export HTML=no
